Expanding the Endgame of Stardew Valley with new Gameplay Mechanics and Features, New Map Locations, Characters, Dialogue and more to come

Brainstorm:

Objective: Expand the Endgame for Stardew Valley

Issue #1: Once money begins rolling in, incentive to play is reduced, less motivation to continue earning money
you get to a rinse and repeat flow to push for the expensive late game items and gameplay 'high' runs out.

Issue #2: to further accelerate money production, you are spending most of the day checking your farms, organizing and selling, tasks are repetitive and ruin the experience

Solutions for #1:
1) Add additional items
2) Add additional Gameplay
3) Create an Economy system to limit excessive money growth
4) create an additional challenge to earning money

Solutions for #2:
1) further delve into automation methods
2) create a method that compacts money earning methods, Ex. 1 parsnip produces 5x crops,
3) create a robust organizing system
4) Diversify tasks ( fix a scarecrow, rebuild a cask), chance based events
5) extending 4 and 1 , manage staff to do the repetitive tasks


Additional Ideas:
must be compatible with SVE and Ridgeside
expand on the main story " return of Joja "
manage an farming empire
create more maps, zoza city, more farmland,
possibly make more characters
create other business ventures ( bakery, winery, etc), have the business cooperate with each other
compete with rivals,
Hire rivals in story lines,
watch employees real time on the farm(and elsewhere) doing work
kids can grow up and take over the empire
